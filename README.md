# Mandiri Technical Test 1: Data Analyst

## Setup and Execution Instructions

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up the database, process the data, and run the analysis for this project.

---

### Part 1: Database and Data Import

**1. Prerequisites:**
* A running instance of `PostgreSQL`.
* A SQL client such as `DBeaver` (recommended for this workflow).

**2. Create a New Database:**
* In your SQL client, connect to your PostgreSQL instance and create a new database.
* Recommended name: `mandiri_analysis_db`.

**3. Import Data & Auto-Create Tables:**
This project leverages DBeaver's ability to automatically create table schemas during the CSV import process. For each of the three provided CSV files (`users_data.csv`, `cards_data.csv`, `transactions_data.csv`), perform the following steps:

1.  In the DBeaver database navigator, right-click on your database schema (e.g., `public`) and select **"Import Data"**.
2.  Choose **"CSV"** as the source and select the corresponding CSV file.
3.  Proceed through the import wizard. In the "Table Mappings" step, ensure you are mapping to a **"New Table"**.
4.  Execute the import. DBeaver will automatically create the table and import the data.
5.  Repeat this process for all three files.

### Part 2: Running the SQL Script

All data cleaning, table modifications, and final analysis are consolidated into a single script for simplicity.

**1. Execute the Main Script:**
* Open the SQL script `Mandiri.sql`.
* Ensure your SQL client is connected to the `mandiri_analysis_db` database.
* Execute the entire script from top to bottom.

**2. Script Contents:**
The `Mandiri.sql` script is designed to be run sequentially and contains two main sections:

* **Data Preprocessing & Schema Refinement:** The first part of the script enhances the tables that were auto-generated by DBeaver. This includes:
    * Adding **Primary Key** and **Foreign Key** constraints to establish proper data relationships.
    * Cleaning financial columns by removing currency symbols (`$`).
    * Altering column data types to their correct numeric or timestamp formats for accurate analysis.

* **Analytical Queries:** The second part of the script contains all the final `SELECT` queries that perform the client segmentation and behavioral analysis. The results from this section are the direct data sources for each chart and table in the Looker Studio dashboard.
